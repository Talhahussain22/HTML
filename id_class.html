    <!-- Id is used for uniquely identification to understand this lets take a example let say you have multiple div tags
    and you want to apply some properties to a specific tag so how you tell computer or html that i want to add this
property on this specific tag for that we make id inside div or other tag and each will have unique to understand this
we made two paragraph and add diff colour using Css (ID should not start with number in html) -->

<!-- On the other hand CLASS is used to connect interrealated code which are in differnet position means means if two tage are at
different position but have same class name then changing in one type in CSS  will effect on both  -->
